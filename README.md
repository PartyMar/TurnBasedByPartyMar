Victory condition: Destroy every unit (green).

Lose condition: Your unit are destroyed (blue).

Control: for selecting unit click on him. If you want unselect, click on him again. After unit selected, click on the nearest tile (unit can move only 1 tile per click). The gray (RuinTile) are unwalkable (for the player team).
